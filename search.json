The primary focus is on addressing key challenges related to shipment and inventory management within the supply chain. The dataset provides three data tables including order_and_shipment, inventory and fulfillment. After examining the data fields, I noticed that the dataset generally represents the following key information Customer: General information about customers including identifiers and addresses Order: Information about the order including date of order, product and quantity ordered, order value Shipment: Shipping information including shipping date, shipping mode Product: Specific information about the ordered item including product name, product category, product department Warehouse Inventory: Information on inventory management for each product name including monthly inventory, warehouse location, storage costs, order fulfillment * * *",
