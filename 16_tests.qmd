Describe your contributions below.

In this section, we  created tests using pytest to validate the functionality of the linear regression model implemented in the project. The test file test_linear_regression_model.py contains several test functions that verify different aspects of the model's behavior:

Test Model Creation: This test ensures that the linear regression model is created successfully without any errors. It checks if the model object is an instance of the LinearRegression class.
Test Model Accuracy: This test evaluates the accuracy of the linear regression model by comparing its predictions against the ground truth on a test dataset. It calculates the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and verifies if it's within an acceptable range.
These tests are designed to ensure that the linear regression model behaves as expected and produces reliable predictions. Running these tests with pytest provides confidence in the correctness of the model implementation.
