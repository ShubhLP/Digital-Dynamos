Hi All!

This project revolves around the need for data analysis in Supply Chain. There are many loopholes in the supply chain process and we took csv files such as products, orders, shipments and fulfilment and checked the process a company undergoes.

We came across results such as the most used mode of payment by the buyers were Debit. There was lack of inventory management in the company's process and not only constrained to flaws in inventory management, we saw that the delivery methods and most of the orders were delayed by the company.

Mehak and Shubham contributed to the data analysis of the project while Burlyn contributed to the poster presentation of the project.

The commits made by Mehak were directed to Prof's name, after fixing the issue, last few commits were directed to her name
